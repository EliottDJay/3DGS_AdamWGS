## AdamWGS
**Motivation:**
- _Update-step coupling in Adam_ implicitly rescales the optimizer state, causing updates even on currently invisible primitives.
- _Gradient coupling in Adam_ may lead to under- or over-regularization.

**Contribution:**
- Decouple Adam in 3DGS optimization and recompose it into three effective components: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, and Decoupled Attribute Regularization.
- Conduct exploratory experiments for different components.
- Propose AdamW-GS, which enables more controllable attribute regularization, and apply it to vanilla 3DGS, 3DGS-MCMC, and additional variants, including MaskGaussian, Taming3DGS, and Deformable Beta Splatting (reported in the Appendix).

## Tutorial

We provide a separate configuration folder for each scene. To run an experiment, simply execute:

```bash
sh execute.sh -c <cuda> -s <seed>
```

where `<cuda>` specifies the GPU device and `<seed>` specifies the random seed.

The `config.yaml` file is provided for convenient modification of experimental settings. More implementation details are similar to [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).

We also provide code files that can be used to replace the corresponding components in Taming-3DGS. After replacement, run:

```
python $ROOT/train.py -s ./dataset/Render/bicycle -i images_4 -m ./  --benchmark_dir ./time --quiet --eval \
    --test_iterations -1  --optimizer_type sparse_ours --budget 5987095  --densification_interval 100 --mode final_count \
    --opacity_reset_interval 3000000 \
    --opacity_penalty_begin 3000 --opacity_penalty_end 14000 --scaling_penalty_begin 1000 --scaling_penalty_end 14000 \
    --rer_exp_avg_inherit --rer_exeavg_fading 0.2 --rer_exp_avgsq_inherit --rer_exeavgsq_fading 0.04 \
    --use_er --er_begin 1000 --er_end 14000 --er_strategy uni_curriculum --ratial_list "0.1,0.3" --ratio_shift "1000,7000" \
    2>&1 | tee ./3dgs_$now.txt


python $ROOT/render.py -m ./

python $ROOT/metrics.py -m ./
```

## Notes

* In the experiments reported in the paper, the default setting uses $N_I/10$. Therefore, all corresponding $\lambda$ values are also scaled by a factor of $1/10$. In the current configuration, we use $N_I$ directly, so the corresponding $\lambda$ values are scaled up by a factor of 10. Please refer to the `experiments` folder for more details. Taming-GS still follows the $N_I/10$ setting.
* When the number of $N_p$ is small, more conservative restart parameters are preferred, such as `0.1` and `1000`, which are used in several scenes of Taming-GS.
* When $N_p$ is much larger than $N_a$, the MCMC-based framework may lead to degraded reconstruction quality.
* We tested different configurations of $\mathcal{C}$ in Eq. 8, including $\{1, 5, 10, 20\}$. The overall differences were minor. Continuing to apply regularization after densification ends brings limited additional benefit.
